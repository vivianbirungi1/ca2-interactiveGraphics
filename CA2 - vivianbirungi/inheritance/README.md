//Covid research:
//Analysed covid using the population of ireland
//focused on the number of infected at 245,319
//number of recovered 222,504 and number of deaths at 4,866
//took the number of infected in the month of april (2,225) and
//found the infection rate in a month by dividing all 3 weeks of april by the total number infected all month.
//infection rate at : 0.24
//got the total number of recovered since covid started and divided by 14 months(length of time covid has existed in ireland), to get number of recovered in one month.
//found the percentage of recovered by adding 3 weeks of april infected numbers and dividing by recovered in one month estimation.
//recovery percentage at 0.0714.
//decreased this gradually based on chances of survigin covid the longer it stays in the system.
//a website stated chances of recovery are higher with a slight decrease by the end of the second week, by weeks three to eight, chances of recovery are lower
//most deaths from covid have been infected from two to six weeks therefore I chose to make a critical and dead that would reflect this.
//the critical can also infect a healthy as some people with no underlying conditions catch covid and can still become critically ill and die.
//overall outcome to reflect the month of april, was to show a higher recovery to death ratio as the general statistics for ireland,
//show there are a high number of cases but also a high number of recovered and a significantly low number of death in comparison to recovered.
//by the end function should display a high number of infected a very low number of dead.
