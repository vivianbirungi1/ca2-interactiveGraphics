Covid research: Analysed covid using the population of Ireland. Focused on the number of infected at 245,319. Number of recovered 222,504 and number of deaths at 4,866.

Took the number of infected in the month of April (2,225) and found the infection rate in a month by dividing all 3 weeks of April by the total number infected all month. 

Infection rate at : 0.24. Got the total number of recovered since covid started and divided by 14 months(length of time covid has existed in Ireland up to this point (2021), to get number of recovered in one month. 
Found the percentage of recovered by adding 3 weeks of april infected numbers and dividing by recovered in one month estimation.

Recovery percentage at 0.0714. Decreased this gradually based on chances of survigin covid the longer it stays in the system. A website stated chances of recovery are higher with a slight decrease by the end of the second week, by weeks three to eight, chances of recovery are lower. 

Most deaths from covid have been infected from two to six weeks therefore I chose to make a critical and dead that would reflect this. The critical can also infect a healthy as some people with no underlying conditions catch covid and can still become critically ill and die. 

Overall outcome to reflect the month of april, was to show a higher recovery to death ratio as the general statistics for Ireland, Shows there are a high number of cases but also a high number of recovered and a significantly low number of death in comparison to recovered. By the end function should display a high number of infected a very low number of dead.
